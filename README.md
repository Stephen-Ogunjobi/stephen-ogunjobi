# 👋 Hi, I'm Stephen

## Full-Stack Engineer | Backend Architecture | Scalable Systems

I build production-ready web applications — from intuitive frontend experiences to scalable backend architecture and cloud infrastructure.

My focus: performance, reliability, clean architecture, and business impact.

## 🧠 System Architecture Approach

I design applications with scalability and maintainability in mind:

- 🔹 Modular backend architecture (NestJS / Express)
- 🔹 RESTful APIs & structured service layers
- 🔹 Relational & NoSQL database design
- 🔹 Caching strategies using Redis
- 🔹 Background jobs & async processing
- 🔹 Dockerized environments for consistency
- 🔹 Cloud deployment & infrastructure (AWS)
- 🔹 Secure authentication & role-based access control

I think beyond features — I build systems that scale.
